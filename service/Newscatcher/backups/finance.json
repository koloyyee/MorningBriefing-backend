We have in our self-managed superannuation fund (SMSF) invested in an apartment worth $550,000, with a mortgage of $190,000, a share portfolio of $240,000 and some cash in a savings account. We're self-employed in retail and intend to be out of the business in two years, after which, we both intend to work part-time. We own the house we are living in outright. Should we try to clear the mortgage within the SMSF completely with the funds sitting in the savings account, or treat it like an investment property by making minimal repayments?That long-established desire to have a negatively geared asset to create a tax deduction to reduce taxable income is not always the best option.",

The agreement was initially approved by the district in a closed-door meeting directly following Ramirez's resignation in June, a move the San Joaquin County's top education official said violated the law. In a letter to the Stockton Unified Board of Trustees and the San Joaquin County District Attorney's Office obtained by ABC10, San Joaquin County Superintendent of Schools Troy Brown said by approving the contract during a closed session of a board meeting and not orally reporting the action when back in open session, the school board violated the Brown Act.",

('Palantir' or the 'Company') (NYSE: PLTR) in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Palantir's common stock between November 9, 2021 and May 6, 2022, both dates inclusive (the 'Class Period'). The Complaint allege that Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Palantir's investments in marketable securities were having a significant negative impact on the Company's earnings per share ('EPS') results; (2) Palantir overstated the sustainability of its government segment's growth and revenues; (3) Palantir was experiencing a significant slowdown in revenue growth, particularly among its government customers, despite ongoing global conflicts and market disruptions; (4) as a result of all the foregoing, the Company was likely to miss consensus estimates for its first quarter 2022 ('Q1') EPS and second quarter 2022 ('Q2') sales outlook; and (5) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.",

A favourable demographic composition (the share of people of working age was 65% in 2020) supports growth potential. The rating is constrained by the high but declining public debt burden, the small size of the economy and limited export diversification that result in vulnerability to external shocks and balance of payments' risks.",

Only four of the adolescents – the youngest was 14 – survived the experience. In Buenos Aires, hundreds of students and activists marched Friday from the square in front of the Argentine Congress to the Plaza de Mayo, which was the most important venue for protests against the junta that seized power in March 1976.",

There are few groups that exemplify risk-on behavior more so than Bitcoin miners, as they are tremendously volatile, and make huge moves in both directions. One such miner is Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT), a stock that I think is in no man's land right now.",
