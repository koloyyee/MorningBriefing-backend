Big Bird from Sesame Street is an example of West Afrikan Puppetry. A person puts on the costume or 'Puppet' and now becomes something else. 15 spots are available for students 7 – 18 years old.",

President Joko Widodo is coordinating with local government leaders and policy makers to identify the source of price pressures in the food supply or energy costs, Indrawati told a Bloomberg Live forum in Singapore moderated by Haslinda Amin. \"That is really up to the central bank, that's why they'll decide if this current inflation is going to affect the expectation of inflation on a more permanent basis then it is time for the central bank to act,' said the finance minister on rate hikes.",

For fund managers, including those gathered at one of the industry's biggest conferences in New York, any optimism from last week's market rally was sapped by a fresh sucker punch on Tuesday as the S&P 500 slid 4.3%. Many funds were already sitting on declines of 30% or more.",

The complaint accused Tesla and Musk of having since 2016 deceptively advertised the technology as fully functioning or \"just around the corner\" despite knowing that the technology did not work or was nonexistent, and made vehicles unsafe. Briggs Matsko, the named plaintiff, said Tesla did this to \"generate excitement\" about its vehicles, attract investments, boost sales, avoid bankruptcy, drive up its stock price and become a \"dominant player\" in electric vehicles.",
